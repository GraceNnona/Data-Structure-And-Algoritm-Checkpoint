Data Structures:
1. Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory 
locations.
2. Linked Lists: A dynamic collection of elements, where each element points to the next 
element.
3. Stacks: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where elements are added and removed 
from the top.
4. Queues: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where elements are added to the end
 and removed from the front.
5. Hash Tables: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.

Sorting Algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through the data, 
comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
2. Selection Sort: A sorting algorithm that selects the smallest (or largest) element 
from the unsorted portion of the data and moves it to the beginning (or end) of the sorted 
portion.
3. Insertion Sort: A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a 
time, inserting each item into its proper position in the sorted array.
4. Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits the data into smaller 
chunks, sorts each chunk, and then merges the sorted chunks back together.
5. Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element, 
partitions the data around the pivot, and then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

Data Structures and Algorithms I'm Not Familiar With:
1. Trie: A prefix tree data structure that stores a dynamic set or associative array where 
the keys are usually strings.
2. Suffix Tree: A tree-like data structure that presents the suffixes of a given string in 
a way that allows for efficient matching and searching.
3. Bloom Filter: A space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test 
whether an element is a member of a set.
4. Topological Sort: A linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such 
that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
6. Heap Sort: A sorting algorithm that uses a heap data structure to sort the data.
7. Radix Sort: A non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing 
individual digits.
5. Trees: A hierarchical data structure, where each node has a value and zero or more 
child nodes.
6. Graphs: A non-linear data structure, where nodes are connected by edges.

Why I'm Not Mastering Them Yet:
1. Lack of practice: I need more hands-on experience with these data structures and 
algorithms to fully understand their implementation and usage.
2. Insufficient theoretical knowledge: I require more in-depth study of the theoretical 
aspects of these data structures and algorithms to fully grasp their concepts and 
applications.
3. Limited exposure to real-world applications: I need more exposure to real-world 
scenarios where these data structures and algorithms are used to appreciate their 
practical significance and importance.
